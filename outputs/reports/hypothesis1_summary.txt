Hypothesis 1 Analysis Report - Handler Execution Performance (execution_ms)

Key Findings:
1. For lightweight tasks:
   - Fermyon shows lower mean execution time in 1 out of 5 functions
   - Fermyon shows lower CV (more consistent performance) in 4 out of 5 functions

2. Statistical Significance:
         function        p_value
0      basic-http   3.893758e-08
1   light-compute  7.458820e-189
2   heavy-compute  9.638882e-227
3       key-value   4.204837e-52
4  query-external  1.025838e-143

Conclusion:
The data does not fully support the hypothesis that Wasm (Fermyon) executes business logic faster than microVMs (AWS) for lightweight computation tasks.

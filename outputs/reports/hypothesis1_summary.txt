Hypothesis 1 Analysis Report - Handler Execution Performance (execution_ms)

Key Findings:
1. For lightweight tasks:
   - Fermyon shows lower mean execution time in 1 out of 5 functions
   - Fermyon shows lower CV (more consistent performance) in 4 out of 5 functions

2. Statistical Significance:
         function       p_value
0      basic-http  5.316172e-01
1   light-compute  1.250339e-35
2   heavy-compute  1.250404e-35
3       key-value  1.250209e-35
4  query-external  1.250404e-35

Conclusion:
The data does not fully support the hypothesis that Wasm (Fermyon) executes business logic faster than microVMs (AWS) for lightweight computation tasks.

Hypothesis 1 Analysis Report - Handler Execution Performance (execution_ms)

Data Distribution Characteristics:
- 0 out of 5 function-platform combinations showed normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk, p > 0.05)
- test_used
mannwhitneyu    5 tests were used based on normality assessment

Key Findings:
1. For lightweight tasks:
   - Fermyon shows lower mean execution time in 1 out of 5 functions
   - Fermyon shows lower CV (more consistent performance) in 4 out of 5 functions

2. Statistical Significance:
         function       p_value     test_used
0      basic-http  5.316172e-01  mannwhitneyu
1   light-compute  1.250339e-35  mannwhitneyu
2   heavy-compute  1.250404e-35  mannwhitneyu
3       key-value  1.250209e-35  mannwhitneyu
4  query-external  1.250404e-35  mannwhitneyu

Conclusion:
The data does not fully support the hypothesis that Wasm (Fermyon) executes business logic faster than microVMs (AWS) for lightweight computation tasks.
